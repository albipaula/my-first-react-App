## Overview

### The Project

Users should be able to:

- Click Tracking: The click counter should accurately record and display the total number of clicks made by the user.
- Resetting the Counter: Users may need to reset the click counter to start counting from zero or to clear the previous count. This option allows them to begin a new tracking session or reset the count for a specific purpose.

## My process

### Built with

- React
- Functional Components
- Node js
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

- Class components 
- Functional components 
- React Developer Tools 
Components can be composed together to build complex user interfaces by nesting them inside other components or reusing them across multiple parts of the application. Code reusability, improves maintainability, and  better organization of the application's codebase.



### Continued development

I'm eager to learn more about React. Solidify my React knowledge  building real-world projects. Start with small, manageable projects and gradually increase the complexity as my progress. 

### Useful resources
